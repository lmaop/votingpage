# E-Chunaav - webbased voting system
E-Chunaav is a full stack web based application which is built with the idea making the election process in india more streamlined and online
but it is practically impossible to make such a huge process entirely online hence it can be used for: <br>
voters or user data collection and then used in analysis and ML models<br>
it can also be used a software for exit polls which is a sample based election procedure.<br>

I Hope one day the election process of every country would be smooth and an online process and until then this is just a dream project
